The sequence of the methylation states of cytosines on any given\\nread forms a methylation pattern that carries substantially more information\\nthan merely studying the average methylation level at individual positions. In\\norder to understand better the complexity of DNA methylation landscapes in\\nbiological samples, it is important to study the diversity of these methylation\\npatterns. However, the accurate quantification of methylation patterns is\\nsubject to sequencing errors and spurious signals due to incomplete bisulphite\\nconversion of cytosines. Results: A statistical model is developed which\\naccounts for the distribution of DNA methylation patterns at any given locus.\\nThe model incorporates the effects of sequencing errors and spurious reads, and\\nenables estimation of the true underlying distribution of methylation patterns.\\nConclusions: Calculation of the estimated distribution over methylation\\npatterns is implemented in the R Bioconductor package MPFE. Source code and\\ndocumentation of the package are also available for download at\\nhttp://bioconductor.org/packages/3.0/bioc/html/MPFE.html.\\n\",\n          \"  There are currently plenty of programs available for mapping short sequences\\n(reads) to a genome. Most of them, however, including such popular and actively\\ndeveloped programs as Bowtie, BWA, TopHat and many others, are based on\\nBurrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithm. This approach is very effective for\\nmapping high-homology reads, but runs into problems when mapping reads with\\nhigh level of errors or SNP. Also it has problems with mapping RNASeq spliced\\nreads (such as reads that aligning with gaps corresponding intron sequences),\\nthe kind that is essential for finding introns and alternative splicing gene\\nisoforms. Meanwhile, finding intron positions is the most important task for\\ndetermining the gene structure, and especially alternatively spliced variants\\nof genes. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that involves hashing\\nreference genome. ReadsMap program, implementing such algorithm, demonstrate\\nvery high-accuracy mapping of large number of short reads to one or more\\ngenomic contigs. It is achieved mostly by better alignment of very short parts\\nof reads separated by long introns with accounting information from mapping\\nother reads containing the same intron inserted between bigger blocks.\\nAvailability and implementation: ReadsMap is implemented in C. It is\\nincorporated in Fgenesh++ gene identification pipeline and is freely available\\nto academic users at Softberry web server www.softberry.com.\\n\",\n          \"  In the past decade, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have delivered an\\nincreasingly broad view of the genetic basis of human phenotypic variation. One\\nof the major developments from GWAS is polygenic scores, a genetic predictor of\\nan individual's genetic predisposition towards a trait constructed from GWAS.\\nThe success of GWAS and polygenic scores seems to suggest that we will soon be\\nable to settle debates about whether phenotypic differences among groups are\\ndriven in part by genetics. However, answering these questions is more\\ncomplicated than it seems at first glance and touches on many old issues about\\nthe interpretation of human genetic variation. In this perspective piece, I\\noutline the ways in which issues of causality, stratification,\\ngene-by-environment interactions, and divergence among groups all complicate\\nthe interpretation of among-population polygenic score differences.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
